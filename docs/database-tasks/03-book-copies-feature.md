# Book Copies Feature Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Complete implementation of the book copies feature for tracking individual physical copies of books. This feature manages inventory at the copy level and tracks availability status for borrowing, supporting the PRD requirement for "multiple physical copies of the same book with unique copy IDs".

## Task Dependencies
**Prerequisites**: Books table must exist (foreign key dependency)  
**Blocks**: Borrowing Transactions feature (needs book_copies table)

---

## Task 1: Book Copies Database Schema
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **NOT STARTED**  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Description
Create the book_copies table schema to track individual physical copies of books, supporting the PRD requirement for copy management and availability tracking.

### PRD Requirements Reference
From PRD Section 2.1.2 Copy Management:
- Add copies: Register multiple physical copies with unique copy IDs
- Track copy status: Monitor availability (Available, Borrowed)
- Copy history: View borrowing history for individual copies

### Database Schema Requirements
- [ ] Create `book_copies` table with inventory tracking:
  - [ ] `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT) - internal database ID
  - [ ] `book_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL) - foreign key to books.id
  - [ ] `copy_id` (VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL) - physical copy identifier (e.g., "B001-C001")
  - [ ] `status` (ENUM: 'available', 'borrowed', 'maintenance', 'lost', 'damaged')
  - [ ] `condition` (ENUM: 'new', 'good', 'fair', 'poor') - physical condition
  - [ ] `location` (VARCHAR(50)) - shelf location in library (e.g., "A-3-2", "Fiction-01")
  - [ ] `acquisition_date` (DATE) - when copy was acquired by library
  - [ ] `notes` (TEXT) - maintenance notes, condition details, history
  - [ ] `created_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  - [ ] `updated_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

- [ ] Add database constraints:
  - [ ] Foreign key to books table: `FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - [ ] `copy_id` must be unique across all copies in library
  - [ ] Status must be valid enum value with CHECK constraint
  - [ ] Condition must be valid enum value with CHECK constraint
  - [ ] Acquisition date cannot be in the future

- [ ] Add performance indexes:
  - [ ] Index on `book_id` (for finding copies of a specific book)
  - [ ] Unique index on `copy_id` (for fast unique copy lookups)
  - [ ] Index on `status` (for availability queries - "available" copies)
  - [ ] Composite index on `book_id, status` (for available copies of specific book)
  - [ ] Index on `location` (for physical inventory management)

### Implementation Steps
1. Create migration file `004-create-book-copies-table.sql`
2. Add table creation with all constraints and foreign keys
3. Add indexes for performance optimization
4. Add status and condition enum validation
5. Test migration with existing books data
6. Verify foreign key relationships work correctly

### Acceptance Criteria
- Book copies table created successfully with all required fields
- Foreign key relationship with books table works correctly
- All constraints and enums function properly
- Indexes improve copy lookup and availability query performance
- Can create multiple copies for the same book
- Copy IDs are enforced as unique across entire system

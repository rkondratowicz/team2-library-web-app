# Members Feature Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Complete implementation of the members feature for library member management according to PRD requirements. This is a standalone feature with no dependencies on other tables.

## Task Dependencies
**Prerequisites**: None (independent table)  
**Blocks**: Borrowing Transactions feature (needs members table to exist)

## Task 1: Members Database Schema
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **NOT STARTED**  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Description
Create the members table schema based on PRD requirements for library member management.

### PRD Requirements Reference
From PRD Section 2.2 Member Management:
- Member registration with name, contact information, address, member ID
- Member profiles with borrowing history and limits
- Search members by name or ID

### Database Schema Requirements
- [ ] Create `members` table with PRD-specified fields:
  - [ ] `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT) - internal database ID
  - [ ] `member_id` (VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL) - external member identifier (e.g., "M001", "MEM2023001")
  - [ ] `first_name` (VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
  - [ ] `last_name` (VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
  - [ ] `email` (VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE) - optional, unique when provided
  - [ ] `phone` (VARCHAR(20)) - optional, formatted phone number
  - [ ] `address` (TEXT) - complete address information
  - [ ] `status` (ENUM: 'active', 'inactive', 'suspended') - membership status
  - [ ] `registration_date` (DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE)
  - [ ] `created_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  - [ ] `updated_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

- [ ] Add database constraints:
  - [ ] `member_id` must be unique across all members
  - [ ] `email` must be unique when not null
  - [ ] Email format validation using CHECK constraint
  - [ ] Phone number format validation (optional)
  - [ ] First name and last name cannot be empty strings
  - [ ] Status must be one of the valid enum values

- [ ] Add performance indexes:
  - [ ] Unique index on `member_id` (for external ID lookups)
  - [ ] Index on `last_name, first_name` (for name searches)
  - [ ] Index on `email` (for email lookups and uniqueness)
  - [ ] Index on `status` (for filtering active/inactive members)
  - [ ] Index on `registration_date` (for member registration analytics)

### Implementation Steps
1. Create migration file `003-create-members-table.sql`
2. Add table creation with all constraints and indexes
3. Add member status enum validation
4. Create member ID generation strategy
5. Test migration on development database

### Acceptance Criteria
- Members table created successfully with all required fields
- All constraints work correctly (test with sample data)
- Indexes improve member search performance
- Invalid data is rejected by database constraints
- Member ID uniqueness is enforced

2. **Member Profile Enhancement**: Can add borrowing history and current loans
3. **Statistics and Reporting**: Member activity analytics per PRD

### Database Relationships
- **Future Integration**: `borrowing_transactions` table will reference `members.id`
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Will prevent member deletion with active borrows
- **Analytics Integration**: Member data will be used in reporting features

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Validate Integration**: Test members feature with existing books feature
2. **Prepare for Book Copies**: Members + Books will enable book copies inventory
3. **Plan Borrowing System**: Core functionality requires both members and book copies
4. **Consider Frontend**: May want to add member management UI
5. **Performance Testing**: Test member operations under expected load

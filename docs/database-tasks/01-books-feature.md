# Books Feature Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Complete implementation of the books feature to align with PRD requirements. This builds on your existing simple books implementation (id, title, author) and enhances it to meet the full PRD specifications.

## Current Status
**‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Basic books functionality exists, needs PRD enhancement

### What's Already Working
- ‚úÖ Basic books table with `id`, `title`, `author` fields
- ‚úÖ Simple BookRepository with CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ BookService with basic business logic
- ‚úÖ API endpoints (`/api/books`, `/api/books/:id`)
- ‚úÖ Frontend displaying books in table format
- ‚úÖ Sample data with 20 books

### What Needs PRD Alignment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Schema Enhancement**: Add ISBN, genre, publication_year, description fields
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Search & Filtering**: Add advanced search capabilities per PRD
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Validation**: Add proper business rules and constraints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Enhancement**: Expand endpoints for full functionality

## Task Dependencies
**Prerequisites**: None (independent feature)  
**Blocks**: Book Copies feature (needs enhanced books table)

---

## Task 1: Enhance Books Database Schema
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** (Basic schema exists, needs enhancement)  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Description
Enhance the existing books table to match PRD requirements while preserving existing data.

### Current Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Enhanced Schema Requirements
- [ ] Add PRD-required fields:
  - [ ] `isbn` (TEXT UNIQUE) - book identifier, can be null for books without ISBN
  - [ ] `genre` (TEXT) - book category/genre
  - [ ] `publication_year` (INTEGER) - year published, with CHECK constraint
  - [ ] `description` (TEXT) - book description/summary
  - [ ] `created_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  - [ ] `updated_at` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

- [ ] Add database constraints:
  - [ ] `isbn` must be unique when provided (allow NULL)
  - [ ] `publication_year` validation (reasonable range: 1400-2030)
  - [ ] Title and author cannot be empty strings

- [ ] Add performance indexes:
  - [ ] Index on `isbn` (for ISBN lookups)
  - [ ] Index on `genre` (for filtering by genre)
  - [ ] Index on `publication_year` (for year-based searches)
  - [ ] Composite index on `title, author` (for search optimization)

### Implementation Steps
1. Create migration file `003-enhance-books-table-prd.sql`
2. Use `ALTER TABLE` statements to add new columns (preserve existing data)
3. Add indexes for new fields
4. Add constraints and validation rules
5. Test migration with existing books data

### Acceptance Criteria
- All new fields added without data loss
- Existing books data remains intact
- New constraints work correctly
- Search performance is improved with indexes

  - [ ] Add all new fields with correct types
  - [ ] Mark optional fields as optional (`isbn?`, `genre?`, `description?`)
  - [ ] Use proper date types for timestamp fields

- [ ] Create supporting types:
  - [ ] `CreateBookRequest` (fields needed for creation)
  - [ ] `UpdateBookRequest` (partial book data for updates)
  - [ ] `BookSearchOptions` (search parameters)
  - [ ] `BookSearchResult` (with relevance scoring)

### Implementation Steps
1. Update existing `Book.ts` interface
2. Add new request/response types
3. Update existing repository and service to use new types
4. Test type safety across the application

### Acceptance Criteria
- All book-related types match database schema

### Enhanced Repository Requirements
- [ ] Update existing methods to handle new fields:
  - [ ] `create(bookData: CreateBookRequest): Promise<Book>`
  - [ ] `update(id: string, updates: UpdateBookRequest): Promise<Book | null>`
  - [ ] Ensure `findAll()` returns all fields

- [ ] Add PRD-specified search capabilities:
  - [ ] `findByIsbn(isbn: string): Promise<Book | null>`

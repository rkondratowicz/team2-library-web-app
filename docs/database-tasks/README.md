# Database Tasks - Feature-Based Implementation Guide

## Overview
This directory contains feature-based task breakdowns for implementing the complete library management system database layer. Tasks are organized by feature with clear dependencies, allowing you to work on independent features first and build up to the complete system.

## **Implementation Strategy: Feature-First Approach**

### **Dependency Order (Critical!)**
```
1. Books Feature (Independent) ‚Üí 
2. Members Feature (Independent) ‚Üí 
3. Book Copies Feature (depends on Books) ‚Üí 
4. Borrowing System (depends on Members + Book Copies) ‚Üí 
5. System Integration (depends on all features)
```

## **Task Files by Implementation Order**

### **Phase 1: Independent Features** üü¢
#### [01 - Books Feature](./01-books-feature.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** (Basic structure done, needs PRD alignment)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours remaining

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Simple books table created (`id`, `title`, `author`)
- ‚úÖ Basic repository and service implemented
- ‚úÖ Simple API endpoints working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs PRD alignment**: Add ISBN, genre, publication_year, description fields

**What's left:**
- Enhance schema to match PRD requirements
- Add advanced search and filtering
- Add proper validation and constraints
- Update API endpoints for full functionality

---

#### [02 - Members Feature](./02-members-feature.md)  
**Status**: üî¥ **NOT STARTED**  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours

**What it includes:**
- Members table schema with PRD-specified fields
- Member repository with search functionality  
- Member service with registration logic
- Member API controller with full CRUD
- Unit tests and seed data

**Why start here**: Members are needed for borrowing but independent of books

---

### **Phase 2: Dependent Features** üü°
#### [03 - Book Copies Feature](./03-book-copies-feature.md)
**Status**: üî¥ **NOT STARTED** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Books Feature Complete**  
**Dependencies**: Books table must exist  
**Estimated Time**: 9-13 hours

**What it includes:**
- Book copies table for inventory management
- Copy repository with availability tracking
- Copy service with status management
- Integration with Books repository
- Unit tests and seed data

**Why third**: Copies need books to exist (foreign key dependency)

---

### **Phase 3: Core System** üî¥
#### [04 - Borrowing System Feature](./04-borrowing-system-feature.md)
**Status**: üî¥ **NOT STARTED** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Members AND Book Copies Complete**  
**Dependencies**: Members + Book Copies tables must exist  
**Estimated Time**: 12-18 hours

**What it includes:**
- Borrowing transactions table
- Complete checkout/return workflow
- Business rules enforcement (3-book limit, overdue handling)
- Borrowing API with all operations
- Integration with all other features
- Comprehensive testing

**Why fourth**: This is the core library functionality connecting everything

---

### **Phase 4: Final Integration** üü£
#### [05 - Integration & Performance](./05-integration-performance.md)
**Status**: üî¥ **NOT STARTED** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires ALL Features Complete**  
**Dependencies**: All previous features  
**Estimated Time**: 16-23 hours

**What it includes:**
- Performance optimization across all tables
- End-to-end integration testing
- Reporting system implementation
- Error handling and logging
- Security implementation
- Production deployment preparation

**Why last**: Brings everything together and optimizes the complete system

## **Current Project Status**

### **‚úÖ What's Already Working**
- **Books Feature**: Basic implementation with simplified schema
- **Database Connection**: SQLite with migration system
- **API Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap UI displaying books

### **üîÑ What Needs PRD Alignment**
- **Books Schema**: Add ISBN, genre, publication_year, description fields
- **Search & Filtering**: Enhance to match PRD requirements
- **Validation**: Add proper business rules and constraints

### **üî¥ What's Missing for Full PRD Compliance**
- **Members Management**: Complete member registration and management system
- **Book Copies**: Individual copy tracking and inventory management
- **Borrowing System**: Core checkout/return functionality
- **Reporting**: Statistics and analytics as specified in PRD

---

## **Getting Started Guide**

### **Step 1: Complete Books Feature PRD Alignment**
Since you already have basic books working, the next step is to enhance it to match PRD requirements:
1. **Enhance Books Schema** - Add missing fields (ISBN, genre, etc.)
2. **Update Repository** - Add search and filtering capabilities
3. **Enhance API** - Add full CRUD with proper validation
4. **Add Tests** - Comprehensive testing for the enhanced feature

### **Step 2: Implement Members Feature**
Once books are fully PRD-compliant:
1. **Create Members Schema** - Full member management tables
2. **Build Member Repository** - CRUD operations and search
3. **Implement Member API** - Registration and management endpoints
4. **Add Member Tests** - Comprehensive testing

### **Step 3: Build Dependent Features**
With both Books and Members complete:
1. **Book Copies Feature** - Individual copy tracking
2. **Borrowing System** - Core library functionality
3. **Integration & Performance** - Final optimization and reporting

## **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **‚úÖ Clear Dependencies**
- No confusion about what needs to be done first
- Can't accidentally break things by working out of order
- Each feature builds on solid foundations

### **‚úÖ Incremental Progress** 
- Each completed feature is a working system component
- Can test and validate each feature independently
- Easier to track progress and identify issues

### **‚úÖ PRD Alignment**
- Each feature directly maps to PRD requirements
- Business logic is grouped logically
- Complete workflows are implemented as units

### **‚úÖ Flexibility**
- Can adapt features based on your specific needs
- Can simplify or enhance based on requirements
- Easy to see what's essential vs. nice-to-have

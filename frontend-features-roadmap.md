# Frontend Features Roadmap - Library Management System

## Overview
This document outlines a feature-by-feature frontend development approach for the Library Management System. Each feature is designed to be built in isolation with clear interfaces, then progressively integrated into the complete application.

## Feature Development Philosophy
- **Isolation First**: Each feature should work independently with mock data
- **Progressive Integration**: Features connect to real APIs after isolation testing
- **Component-Based**: Reusable UI components across features
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design from the start
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant interfaces

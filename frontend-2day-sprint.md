## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Day 1 Focus**: Individual Feature Isolation
- Each feature works standalone with mock data
- Use simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or minimal framework)
- Focus on functionality over design
- Test each feature independently

### **Day 2 Focus**: Integration & Polish  
- Connect features to backend APIs (when ready)
- Link features together (navigation)
- Add error handling and loading states
- Basic styling and responsiveness

## üìã Success Criteria (End of Day 2)

### **Core User Journeys Must Work**:
1. ‚úÖ **View all books** in the system
2. ‚úÖ **Add a new book** to the catalog  
3. ‚úÖ **Search for books** by title/author
4. ‚úÖ **Edit/delete books** from catalog
5. ‚úÖ **Add new members** to the system
6. ‚úÖ **Check out books** to members
7. ‚úÖ **Return books** from members
8. ‚úÖ **See basic statistics** and navigate between sections

### **Technical Requirements**:
- All features work with mock data (Day 1 end)
- All features integrate with real APIs (Day 2 end)
- Basic responsive design (works on mobile)
- No major bugs in core workflows
- Clean, readable code for future development

## üéØ What We're NOT Building (Save for Later)

‚ùå **Advanced Search/Filtering** - Basic search only  
‚ùå **User Authentication** - No login system yet  
‚ùå **Advanced Analytics** - Basic counts only  
‚ùå **Image Uploads** - Text-only book data  
‚ùå **Barcode Scanning** - Manual ID entry  
‚ùå **Email Notifications** - No notification system  
‚ùå **Advanced UI/Animations** - Functional but simple  
‚ùå **Copy Management** - One copy per book for now  
‚ùå **Overdue Tracking** - Simple borrow/return only  
‚ùå **Member Profiles** - Basic member info only  

## ü§ù Coordination with Backend Team

### **APIs Needed by End of Day 1**:
```
GET /api/books - List all books
POST /api/books - Create new book  
GET /api/members - List all members
POST /api/members - Create new member
```

### **APIs Needed by End of Day 2**:
```
PUT /api/books/:id - Update book
DELETE /api/books/:id - Delete book
POST /api/borrows - Checkout book
PUT /api/borrows/:id/return - Return book
GET /api/dashboard/stats - Basic counts
```
This focused approach ensures we have a working library system in 2 days with all core functionality operational!

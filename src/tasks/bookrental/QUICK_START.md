# Quick Start Guide - Book Rental Tracking

## 🚀 Ready to Begin Implementation

### Current System Status
Your library management system already has:
- ✅ **Books API** - Complete with CRUD operations
- ✅ **Members API** - Complete with CRUD operations  
- ✅ **Transactions API** - Complete borrowing/returning system
- ✅ **Database** - SQLite with `borrowing_transactions` table

### 🎯 Main Goal
Create features that answer: **"Which members have borrowed Book X?"** and **"What books has Member Y borrowed?"**

---

## 📋 Implementation Order (Recommended)

### Start Here: Task 1 - Member-Book Association Queries
**File to create**: `src/application/services/RentalAnalyticsService.ts`

**First feature to build**:
```typescript
// Get all members who have ever borrowed a specific book
async getMembersByBookId(bookId: string): Promise<MemberBorrowRecord[]>
```

**Sample query**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT m.*, bt.borrow_date, bt.return_date, bt.due_date
FROM members m 
JOIN borrowing_transactions bt ON m.id = bt.member_id 
WHERE bt.book_id = ?
ORDER BY bt.borrow_date DESC
```

### Then: Task 2 - Current Borrowers API
**File to create**: `src/presentation/controllers/RentalController.ts`

**First endpoint**:
```typescript
// GET /api/rentals/books/:bookId/current-borrowers
async getCurrentBorrowersForBook(req: Request, res: Response)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### 1. Test Data Setup
Your system already has sample books and members. Test with:
- **Book ID**: Any from `/api/books` 
- **Member ID**: Any from `/api/members`

### 2. Sample API Calls to Build
```bash
# Who currently has "Pride and Prejudice"?
GET /api/rentals/books/{bookId}/current-borrowers

# What books does John Smith currently have?
GET /api/rentals/members/{memberId}/current-books

# Who has ever borrowed "1984"?
GET /api/rentals/books/{bookId}/borrowers/history
```

### 3. Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "book_id": "123",
  "book_title": "Pride and Prejudice",
  "current_borrowers": [
    {
      "member_id": "MEM-2024-001",
      "member_name": "John Smith",
      "borrow_date": "2025-09-20",
      "due_date": "2025-10-04",
      "is_overdue": false
    }
  ],
  "total_current_borrowers": 1
}
```

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### 1. Use Existing Patterns
Follow the same structure as:
- `BookService.ts` and `MemberService.ts` for services
- `BookController.ts` and `MemberController.ts` for controllers
- Existing database connection patterns

### 2. Database Relationships
Your `borrowing_transactions` table connects:
- `book_id` → `books.id`
- `member_id` → `members.id`
- `return_date` IS NULL = currently borrowed
- `return_date` IS NOT NULL = returned

### 3. Error Handling
Include proper error handling for:
- Invalid book/member IDs
- Database connection issues
- Empty result sets

### 4. Performance
Start simple, optimize later:
- Begin with basic queries
- Add indexes if queries become slow
- Consider pagination for large result sets

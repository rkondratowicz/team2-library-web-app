### Step 3: Member Repository
**File**: `03-member-repository.md`
- Implement database operations layer
- Create search and filtering methods
- Add member statistics and analytics queries

### Step 4: Member Service
**File**: `04-member-service.md`
- Implement business logic and validation
- Add member status management operations
- Create data validation and business rules

### Step 5: Member Controller
**File**: `05-member-controller.md`

- Implement request/response handling
- Add error handling and validation

### Step 6: API Integration & Testing
**File**: `06-api-integration-testing.md`

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Member search and filtering
- ✅ Member status management (Active, Inactive, Suspended)
- ✅ Member statistics and analytics
- ✅ Unique member ID generation
- ✅ Email and phone validation

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/members` - List all members
- `GET /api/members/:id` - Get member by ID
- `POST /api/members` - Create new member
- `PUT /api/members/:id` - Update member
- `DELETE /api/members/:id` - Delete member
- `GET /api/members/search` - Search members
- `GET /api/members/stats` - Member statistics
- `PATCH /api/members/:id/suspend` - Suspend member
- `PATCH /api/members/:id/reactivate` - Reactivate member

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    member_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,        -- MEM-YYYY-XXX format
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,                     -- Optional, validated
    phone TEXT,                            -- Optional, validated
    address TEXT,                          -- Optional
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',          -- active, inactive, suspended
    registration_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Implementation Order

Follow these steps in sequence for successful implementation:

1. **Start with Database** - Create migration and schema first
2. **Define Types** - Set up TypeScript interfaces and types
3. **Build Data Layer** - Implement repository for database operations
4. **Add Business Logic** - Create service layer with validation
5. **Create API Layer** - Implement REST controller
6. **Integrate & Test** - Add routes to app and test end-to-end

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: SQLite with proper indexes and constraints
- **Backend**: TypeScript, Express.js, Node.js
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- **Validation**: Custom validation with business rules
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response format

## Next Steps After Implementation
1. Add member management UI to frontend
2. Implement member borrowing system integration
3. Add member photo uploads
4. Create member activity logging
5. Add email notifications
6. Implement member reports and analytics dashboard

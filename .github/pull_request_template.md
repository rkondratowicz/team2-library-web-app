# Pull Request: Complete CRUD Operations - Delete & Edit Book Functionality

## üéØ Summary

This PR completes the full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the library management system by implementing **Delete Book** and **Edit Book** functionality. Building on the existing Add Book and Search features, users can now perform comprehensive book management operations.

## üìã Changes Made

### üóëÔ∏è Delete Book Feature
- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Added `deleteBook(id)` method to `BookRepository` with SQL DELETE query
  - Enhanced `DatabaseConnection.run()` to return `{changes, lastID}` for proper result tracking
  - Added `deleteBook(id)` method to `BookService` with validation (checks book exists before deletion)
  - Added `deleteBook` HTTP endpoint to `BookController` with proper status codes (204 for success, 404 for not found)
  - Registered `DELETE /api/books/:id` route in Express app

- **Frontend Implementation:**
  - Added red "üóëÔ∏è Delete" buttons to each book row in the table
  - Implemented confirmation dialog with book title for user safety
  - Added `deleteBook(bookId, bookTitle)` JavaScript function
  - Automatic table refresh after successful deletion
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### ‚úèÔ∏è Edit Book Feature
- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Added `updateBook(id, bookData)` method to `BookRepository` with SQL UPDATE query
  - Added `updateBook(id, bookData)` method to `BookService` with comprehensive validation:
    - Same validation rules as create book (title/author required, ISBN format, year limits)
    - Special handling for ISBN duplicates (excludes current book from duplicate check)
    - Validates book exists before updating
  - Added `updateBook` HTTP endpoint to `BookController` (200 OK with updated data)
  - Registered `PUT /api/books/:id` route in Express app

- **Frontend Implementation:**
  - Added blue "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" buttons next to delete buttons in each book row
  - Created professional Bootstrap modal with form fields for all book properties
  - Implemented `editBook(bookId)` function that fetches current data and populates modal
  - Added `updateBook()` function for form submission and API calls
  - Client-side validation matching server-side rules
  - Real-time success/error feedback in modal
  - Auto-refresh table and auto-close modal after successful updates

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

  - Added "Actions" column to book table with Edit and Delete buttons
  - Updated table colspan for empty state from 6 to 7 columns
  - Improved button styling with Bootstrap classes and spacing

## üîß Technical Details

  - Enhanced `DatabaseConnection.run()` method to return SQLite result metadata
  - Improved error handling in repository layer with proper change tracking

- **Validation System:**
  - Consistent validation rules across create and update operations
  - Proper ISBN duplicate checking (excludes current book during updates)
  - Publication year validation (max 2025, min -3000 for ancient texts)

- **HTTP Status Codes:**
  - Proper REST API status codes (200 for updates, 204 for deletes, 404 for not found)
